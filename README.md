# KiiToolkit - iOS
### What is KiiToolkit?
A library of utilities for iOS that is designed to make your app development simpler!

Includes not only utilities for developing on [Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com "Kii Cloud"), but also general utilities for nice UI elements and other convenient utilities that we find useful in app development.

### How do I use it?
Check out the repository and drag/drop any or all the files you'd like to utilize into your project. The easiest way is to include all .h/.m files, as some classes are dependent on others - but if you'd like to mix and match, you're more than welcome to do so.

> For installation instructions, check out our [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/KiiPlatform/KiiToolkit-iOS/wiki/Getting-Started "Getting Started Guide")

> KiiToolkit is now a CocoaPod! Add `KiiToolkit` to your Podfile

### Is there documentation?
Yes! The Github wiki will be populated with tutorials and examples as we write them; we suggest starting there. You can also get the full [Appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/ "AppleDoc")-style documentation within the repository. Simply checkout the repo and navigate to Documentation/html/. Open the index.html file in your web browser and navigate as needed. 

Not only is every class and method fully documented, but we strive to make well-commented code as well.. so feel free to dig through the source files and modify as you see fit!

### What is Kii Cloud?
[Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com "Kii Cloud") is a Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) which provides client SDKs for you to build a cloud-connected application without ever building or maintaining any servers or databases. Kii Cloud scales with your app and provides a reliable backend, allowing you to get your app up and running in a fraction of the time.

### Is KiiToolkit an official part of Kii Cloud?
KiiToolkit is created to help developers, and is subject to change at any time. The project is developed separately and does not have any guarantees of maintenance or upgrades as Kii Cloud evolves.
