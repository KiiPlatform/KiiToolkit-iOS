# KiiToolkit - iOS
### What is KiiToolkit?
A library of utilities for iOS that is designed to make your app development simpler!

Includes not only utilities for developing on [Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com "Kii Cloud"), but also general utilities for nice UI elements and other convenient utilities that we find useful in app development.

### How do I use it?
Check out the repository and drag/drop any or all the files you'd like to utilize into your project. The easiest way is to include all .h/.m files, as some classes are dependent on others - but if you'd like to mix and match, you're more than welcome to do so.

### Is there documentation?
Yes! The Github wiki will be populated with tutorials as we write them, and we suggest starting there. You can also get the full [Appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/ "AppleDoc")-style documentation within the repository. Simply checkout the repo and navigate to Documentation/html/. Open the index.html file in your web browser and navigate as needed. 

Not only is every class and method fully documented, but we strive to make well-commented code as well.. so feel free to dig through the source files and modify as you see fit!

### What is Kii Cloud?
[Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com "Kii Cloud") is a Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) which provides client SDKs for you to build a cloud-connected application without ever building or maintaining any servers or databases. Kii Cloud scales with your app and provides a reliable backend, allowing you to get your app up and running in a fraction of the time.
